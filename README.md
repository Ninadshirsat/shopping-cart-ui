# Shopping Cart UI üõí

This project is a simple shopping cart user interface built with React.It demonstrates the practical use of the **useContext** hook for global state management, along with **useState** for local state. Additionally, it integrates with a **JSON Server** to simulate a backend, providing a more realistic environment for testing product data and cart functionalities.
